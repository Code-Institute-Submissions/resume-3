Resume Project

I have created a portfolio resume for the user centric development module milestone project. The content of the page was written by me.

UX
It is my plan to convey my interest in web development from the front end to the back end. By showcasing my design of front-end web pages as well as the layout and structure of modern applications.

As a recruiter, I want to see the works and stylings of a junior developer, so that I can find potential candidates for a team.
